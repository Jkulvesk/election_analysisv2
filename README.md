# election_analysis

## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections employee gave me a task to calculate the election results including the total of votes, total of votes by candidate, percent of votes by candidate and calculation of the winner.

## Resources
The file used to calculate the data was the election_results.csv.
I am using python 3.7.6 for this analysis.

## Summary
These are the steps I used to calculate the results. The final analysis is written to the election_analysis.txt file.
1.Opened the data file.
2.Find the names of all the candidates and printed out to a list
3. Added up the votes for all the candidates.
4. Got the total votes for each candidates.
5. Winner based on popular vote - total votes each candidate/total votes

Here's a summary of the results of the analysis (included in the election_analysis.text file).
